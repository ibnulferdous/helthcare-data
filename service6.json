    "description": "Kids speech-language evaluation involves targeting the condition(s) for which you were referred. Testing begins with a phone call to you to discuss why you were referred and the main problems. In the assessment, we will further explore your feelings and questions about the condition and get to know you better so we can understand how the communication deficit is impacting your life and what you would like to achieve. We also have you fill out a questionnaire prior to the assessment so we have a comprehensive picture of your history to help us know you better. Actual testing may involve use of pictures, objects, stories, reading, writing, drawing, copying, questions, conversation, and other means to assess your skills. Skills tested may range from articulation, voice and fluency to receptive and expressive language, memory, and social communication.",
